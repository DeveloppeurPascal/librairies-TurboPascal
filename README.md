# Procedures and functions libraries for Turbo Pascal developers

[Cette page en français.](LISEZMOI.md)

Reusable units and components, toolbox for good old Turbo Pascal under MS-Dos.

Some units may still be useful for developers under [Free Pascal (FPC)](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/free-pascal.html), [Lazarus](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/lazarus.html), [Delphi](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/delphi.html) or other environments but it is likely that what was missing at the time from what Borland provided has since been added in the various modern Pascal development environments. After all it's been more than 30 years... my needs were probably the same as for other developers who knew that time or nowadays.

These source files date from 1990 to 1995. I used them in my Turbo Pascal projects under MS-Dos.

They are provided as is. No maintenance will be done but if you have any question [contact me](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/nous-contacter.php) or [open an issue](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/librairies-TurboPascal/issues).

## Talks and conferences

### Twitch

Follow my development streams of software, video games, mobile applications and websites on [my Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/patrickpremartin) or as replays on [Serial Streameur](https://serialstreameur.fr) mostly in French.

## Documentation and support

I use comments in [XMLDOC](https://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/en/XML_Documentation_Comments) format in Delphi to document my projects. They are recognized by Help Insight, which offers real-time input help in the code editor.

I regularly use the [DocInsight](https://devjetsoftware.com/products/documentation-insight/) tool to enter them and check their formatting.

Documentation is exported in HTML by [DocInsight](https://devjetsoftware.com/products/documentation-insight/) or [PasDoc](https://pasdoc.github.io) to the /docs folder of the repository. You can also [access it online](https://developpeurpascal.github.io/librairies-TurboPascal) through the hosting offered by GitHub Pages.

Further information (tutorials, articles, videos, FAQ, talks and links) can be found on [the project website](https://pascallib.developpeur-pascal.fr/) or [the project devlog](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/mes-librairies-pour-turbo-pascal.html).

If you need explanations or help in understanding or using parts of this project in yours, please [contact me](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/nous-contacter.php). I can either direct you to an online resource, or offer you assistance in the form of a paid or free service, depending on the case.
