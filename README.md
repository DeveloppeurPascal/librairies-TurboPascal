# Procedures and functions libraries for Turbo Pascal developers

Reusable units and components, toolbox for good old Turbo Pascal under MS-Dos.

Some units may still be useful for developers under [Free Pascal (FPC)](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/free-pascal.html), [Lazarus](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/lazarus.html), [Delphi](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/delphi.html) or other environments but it is likely that what was missing at the time from what Borland provided has since been added in the various modern Pascal development environments. After all it's been more than 30 years... my needs were probably the same as for other developers who knew that time or nowadays.

These source files date from 1990 to 1995. I used them in my Turbo Pascal projects under MS-Dos.

They are provided as is. No maintenance will be done but if you have any question, don't hesitate to open [a discussion](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/librairies-TurboPascal/discussions).
